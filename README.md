# Unity Project: Quizzer (College Project)

Welcome to my Unity repository, where I share my project developed as part of my digital games college course.

## Project description

### Quizzer
The player can create a room that a code is automatically generated for other users to enter, the room host can choose between different themes or create their own themes and questions through the menu, the system is shared so we hope that users will not make inappropriate themes .
